# keystroke-codes
A key code reference for doing stuff with javascript on websites.

Is here: [http://whaleen.github.io/keystroke-codes/](http://whaleen.github.io/keystroke-codes/)

Look up key codes from a-z and 0-9 by pressing them.

If you want to use any of the code note that:

- HTML and JS are far from DRY. Those would be todos
- js/keystoke.js should be done in pure Javascript, lose the jQUery
- Tachyons is used for the CSS and you can learn about that here [http://tachyons.io/docs](http://tachyons.io/docs). 
- It's using only one class from css/animate.css
